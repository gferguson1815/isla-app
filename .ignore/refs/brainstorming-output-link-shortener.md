# Link Shortener Platform - Brainstorming Session Output

**Date:** 2025-09-18
**Facilitator:** Mary (Business Analyst)
**Topic:** Link Shortener App Strategy & Positioning

## Executive Summary

Through structured brainstorming, we've identified a clear market opportunity: **A modern link management platform for the overlooked SMB middle market** - sitting between basic tools (Bitly) and complex enterprise solutions (Dub.co).

## Core Insights Discovered

### 1. Market Gap Identified

- **Old Guard (Bitly, Rebrandly):** Outdated tech, poor UX, big price jumps ($0→$35)
- **New Developer-First (Dub.co):** Too complex for non-technical users, enterprise-focused
- **The Gap:** Modern, user-friendly solution for SMBs with smooth pricing progression

### 2. Target Positioning

**"The Notion of Link Management"**

- Simple enough for individuals
- Powerful enough for growing teams
- Extensible without complexity
- Focus on collaboration over API complexity

### 3. Primary Target User

**Sarah, Marketing Manager (20-person company)**

- Not technical
- Needs campaign tracking
- Wants team collaboration
- Values modern, intuitive tools
- Currently doing manual tracking

## Strategic Direction

### Core Differentiators

1. **User-first, not developer-first** (unlike Dub.co)
2. **Modern and collaborative** (unlike Bitly)
3. **SMB-appropriate pricing** ($0→$19→$49, not $0→$35)
4. **Team collaboration features** (comments, workflows, assignments)
5. **Mobile-first + extensions** (not just web)

### Product Philosophy

- **Setup:** Minutes, not hours
- **Knowledge Required:** Zero technical knowledge
- **Interface Feel:** Like Notion or Vercel
- **Core Promise:** Beautiful, simple, extensible

- ✅ Team workspaces
- ✅ Beautiful UI/UX
- ✅ Simple onboarding

### Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4)

## User Journey & Monetization

### Product Ladder

1. **Individual (Free):** 50 links/month → Get hooked on modern UX
2. **Team ($19/mo):** 500 links, 3 users → Need collaboration
3. **Growth ($49/mo):** 2000 links, 10 users → Want analytics/domains
4. **Scale ($99/mo):** 10000 links, 25 users → Need white-label

### Growth Strategy

- **Inherently viral** - every link markets the product
- **Chrome extension** for distribution
- **Custom domains** for credibility
- **Product-led growth** - no sales team needed

## Three User Stories (from Dub.co model)

1. **Marketing Attribution:** Easy tracking and measurement of campaign impact
2. **Content Creator Insights:** Learn about audience through interactions
3. **Affiliate Management:** Create affiliates, automate payouts

_Priority: Start with Marketing Attribution for MVP_

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Nail the onboarding** - SMBs must self-serve successfully
2. **Price it right** - Natural progression that grows with the business
3. **Ship fast, iterate faster** - Agility is the advantage over competitors

## Competitive Positioning Statement

"Unlike Dub.co, we're the only link management platform that **marketing teams actually enjoy using daily** because we **prioritized collaborative UX over API complexity**. We're building the link management platform that teams actually want to use."

## Solo Founder Advantages

- Link shorteners are inherently viral (self-marketing)
- Custom domains provide built-in credibility
- SMB focus enables self-serve model
- Marketing background = understanding target customer
- AI-powered development = rapid iteration

## Next Steps

1. Build MVP with AI tools (Claude Code, etc.)
2. Launch with core features
3. Get real user feedback
4. Iterate based on actual usage
5. Consider lifetime deals for early traction

## Key Risks Identified

- Dub.co moving downmarket
- Market size for SMB segment
- Differentiation being too subtle

## Unique Opportunities

- Overlooked middle market is substantial
- Modern tools with simple pricing have proven demand
- Team collaboration in link management is underserved
- AI development tools enable solo founder to compete
