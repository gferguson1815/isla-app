# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Isla

## Overview
Isla is a modern link shortening and analytics platform with workspace management and partner program capabilities.

## Development Approach
We use **Page-Based Development** where each page is fully specified before implementation.

## Requirements Structure

### üìã Page Requirements
Each page has detailed requirements documented in:
- **Location**: `/docs/pages/[page-name]-requirements.md`
- **Template**: `/docs/pages/TEMPLATE-requirements.md`
- **Process**: Requirements MUST be gathered and validated BEFORE any development

## Development Process

### Requirements Gathering During Story Creation
1. SM agent gathers requirements DURING story drafting
2. Requirements captured interactively from Product Owner
3. Requirements document created as part of the process
4. Story created based on gathered requirements

### Story Creation Flow
When creating stories with BMAD agents:
1. **If requirements don't exist**: SM gathers them during draft
2. **If requirements exist**: SM references the document
3. Include acceptance criteria from requirements
4. Add technical context from architecture

### The Reality
- Not all pages have requirements upfront
- Requirements gathered when we decide to build that page
- SM agent asks questions and documents answers
- Creates both requirements doc AND story in one flow

### Quality Gates
- Requirements validated
- Story approved
- Development complete
- Tests passing
- QA review passed
- User acceptance

## References

### Key Documents
- **Development Plan**: `/docs/prd/page-based-development-plan.md`
- **Requirements Tracking**: `/docs/prd/requirements-tracking.md`
- **Architecture**: `/docs/architecture/architecture.md`
- **Process**: `/docs/prd/development-process-and-roles.md`

### Requirements Documents
All page requirements are in `/docs/pages/` directory:
- Use TEMPLATE-requirements.md for new pages
- Each page must have validated requirements before development
- Requirements include visual design, interactions, validation, edge cases

## Notes for BMAD Agents

When using BMAD agents (`/sm`, `/dev`, `/qa`):
- **SM**: Reference requirements from `/docs/pages/[page]-requirements.md`
- **SM**: Use epic files from `/docs/stories/epic-*.md`
- **Dev**: Follow requirements exactly as specified
- **QA**: Validate against requirements document
