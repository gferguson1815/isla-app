## üóÑÔ∏è Storage Requirements

### Supabase Storage Configuration
‚úÖ **CONFIRMED** - Using Supabase Storage for all file uploads:

**Bucket Structure:**
```
workspace-logos/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {workspace_id}/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logo.{ext}  (e.g., logo.png, logo.jpg)
```

**Storage Settings:**
- Bucket name: `workspace-logos`
- Public bucket: Yes (logos need to be publicly accessible)
- Max file size: 5MB
- Allowed MIME types: `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/svg+xml`, `image/webp`
- File naming: Use workspace ID to avoid conflicts
- CDN URL format: `{SUPABASE_URL}/storage/v1/object/public/workspace-logos/{workspace_id}/logo.{ext}`

**Upload Process:**
1. Validate file on client (type, size)
2. Generate unique filename using workspace ID
3. Upload to Supabase Storage
4. Get public URL
5. Save URL to workspace record in database

**Security Considerations:**
- Validate file type on both client and server
- Check file size limits
- Scan for malicious content if possible
- Use RLS policies to control who can upload/delete

## üìù Notes Section
- Logo upload is required during workspace creation
- Consider adding image optimization/resizing in future
- May want to add support for animated logos (GIF) later
- Storage costs are minimal for logos (small files, one per workspace)
