## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

Story 2.5 (Core Navigation & Command System) successfully implemented:

- Global navigation system with workspace switcher in place
- Command palette infrastructure with extensible architecture
- Universal search across workspace resources
- Comprehensive tRPC service layer patterns established
- shadcn/ui components proven effective for complex interactions

Key learnings:
- tRPC permission checking pattern already established in workspace router
- Permission-based UI hiding already implemented in team-members-list.tsx
- Workspace role system (owner/admin/member) already fully functional
- Need to extend permission patterns to link management operations

### Data Models

**Existing Permission System** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#WorkspaceMembership Model]

```typescript
interface WorkspaceMembership {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  workspaceId: string;
  role: "owner" | "admin" | "member";
  joinedAt: Date;
  user?: User;
  workspace?: Workspace;
}
```

**Current Role Permissions** [Source: observed from app/server/routers/workspace.ts]

- **Owner**: All permissions, cannot be removed, workspace deletion
- **Admin**: Manage workspace, invite/remove members (except other admins), all link operations
- **Member**: View workspace, create links, edit own links only

### API Specifications

**Existing Permission Patterns** [Source: app/server/routers/workspace.ts:280-295]

```typescript
// Current pattern used in workspace router
const membership = await ctx.prisma.workspace_memberships.findFirst({
  where: {
    user_id: ctx.userId,
    workspace_id: workspaceId,
    role: { in: ['owner', 'admin'] },
  },
});

if (!membership) {
  throw new TRPCError({
    code: 'FORBIDDEN',
    message: 'Insufficient permissions to update workspace',
  });
}
```

**Required New Permission Checks** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md]

- `link.create` - Allow all members
- `link.update` - Admin/owner + own links for members
- `link.delete` - Admin/owner + own links for members
- `link.bulkOperations` - Admin/owner only

### Component Specifications

**UI Framework** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- shadcn/ui components for consistent UI elements
- Permission-based conditional rendering with React hooks
- Lucide React icons for role badges and permission indicators
- Tailwind CSS for styling permission states

**Permission UI Patterns** [Source: observed from components/workspace/team-members-list.tsx:169-170]

```typescript
const canManageMembers = currentUserRole === 'owner' || currentUserRole === 'admin';
const canChangeRoles = currentUserRole === 'owner';

// UI conditional rendering
{canManageMembers && (
  <TableHead className="w-[50px]"></TableHead>
)}
```

### File Locations

Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md and observed structure]:

**Permission System:**
- `lib/permissions/index.ts` - Permission constants and helpers
- `lib/permissions/backend.ts` - Server-side permission utilities
- `lib/middleware/permissions.ts` - tRPC middleware helpers
- `hooks/usePermissions.ts` - React permission hooks
- `components/permissions/PermissionGuard.tsx` - Permission wrapper component

**Updated Components:**

- `app/server/routers/workspace.ts` - Enhance existing permission checks
- `packages/shared/src/types/permissions.ts` - Permission type definitions

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Unit Tests (60%):**
- Permission utility functions in `lib/__tests__/permissions.test.ts`
- Permission hooks in `hooks/__tests__/usePermissions.test.ts`
- Backend permission helpers in `lib/__tests__/permissions.backend.test.ts`

**Component Tests (30%):**
- PermissionGuard component in `components/permissions/__tests__/`
- Permission-based UI rendering in existing component tests
- Permission hook integration tests

**E2E Tests (10%):**
- Complete role-based workflows in `tests/e2e/permissions.spec.ts`
- Permission enforcement across different user roles
- Link management permission scenarios

**Testing Standards:**
- Use Vitest for unit and component tests
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock permission contexts and user roles
- Test both positive and negative permission scenarios

### Technical Constraints

**Security Requirements:**
- All permission checks must be enforced at API level, not just UI
- UI permission hiding is for UX only, not security
- Permission checks must be consistent across all tRPC procedures
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation

**Performance Considerations:**
- Permission hooks should use React.useMemo for expensive calculations
- Permission checks should be cached within user session
- Avoid excessive database queries for permission validation
- Use workspace membership context to minimize API calls

### Implementation Notes

**Existing Permission Infrastructure:**
- Workspace router already implements comprehensive permission checking
- Team members list component demonstrates permission-based UI patterns
- Role system (owner/admin/member) fully functional and tested
- Need to extend patterns to link management and other operations

**Permission Strategy:**
- Use existing workspace membership role as source of truth
- Implement permission helpers for consistent checking across codebase
- Create reusable permission components for UI conditional rendering
- Follow established tRPC error handling patterns for permission failures

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Architecture:**
- Using App Router in Next.js 14.2+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Following tRPC service layer pattern established in workspace router
- Consistent with shadcn/ui component approach
- Permission system integrates with existing Zustand state management

## Testing

### Test File Locations

- Permission utilities: `lib/__tests__/permissions.test.ts`
- Permission hooks: `hooks/__tests__/usePermissions.test.ts`
- Backend permissions: `lib/__tests__/permissions.backend.test.ts`
- Component tests: `components/permissions/__tests__/PermissionGuard.test.tsx`
- API tests: `app/server/routers/__tests__/permissions.test.ts`
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/permissions.spec.ts`

### Testing Standards

**Permission Testing Requirements:**
- Test all three roles (owner, admin, member) in each scenario
- Verify API-level permission enforcement (security critical)
- Test UI conditional rendering for all permission states
- Mock workspace membership contexts for isolated testing
- Test permission edge cases and role transitions

**Test Scenarios:**
- Admin can invite/remove members but not change owner role
- Members can only edit their own links, not others'
- Owners can perform all operations including role changes
- Permission checks work consistently across all API endpoints
- UI elements properly hidden/shown based on user role

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-19

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The permission system implementation is well-structured with clear separation of concerns. The core permission framework provides comprehensive role-based access control with proper constants, helper functions, and backend enforcement. However, there are critical issues with test quality and TypeScript compilation that need immediate attention.

### Key Findings

1. **Test Suite Failures**: The `usePermissions` hook tests have significant failures (13 out of 67 tests failing) due to mismatched API expectations. Tests expect properties like `role`, `isOwner()`, `isAdmin()` that don't exist in the actual implementation which provides `currentRole` instead.

2. **TypeScript Compilation Errors**: Multiple type errors found:
   - References to non-existent `tags` table and field in link router (lines 117, 127, 135, 286, etc.)
   - Missing Stripe module dependencies
   - Middleware type mismatches in permissions module
   - Total of 52+ compilation errors that prevent production build

3. **Missing Database Schema**: The implementation references a `tags` table that doesn't exist in the Prisma schema, causing all tag-related operations to fail at runtime.

### Refactoring Performed

None performed due to critical blocking issues that require developer intervention first.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✗ TypeScript compilation failing
- Project Structure: ✓ Files properly organized according to architecture
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Test failures prevent validation
- All ACs Met: ✗ System not functional due to compilation errors

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical Issues (Must Fix)**:
- [ ] Fix usePermissions hook tests to match actual API (expecting wrong property names)
- [ ] Add missing `tags` table to Prisma schema or remove tag functionality
- [ ] Install missing Stripe dependencies (`stripe`, `@stripe/stripe-js`)
- [ ] Fix TypeScript errors in middleware permissions module
- [ ] Regenerate Prisma client after schema updates

**High Priority**:
- [ ] Update test expectations to use `currentRole` instead of `role`
- [ ] Remove non-existent methods from tests (`isOwner()`, `isAdmin()`, `isMember()`)
- [ ] Add integration tests for permission enforcement at API level
- [ ] Validate all tRPC procedures have proper permission checks

**Medium Priority**:
- [ ] Add explicit return types to all permission functions
- [ ] Consider adding permission caching to reduce database queries
- [ ] Add comprehensive E2E tests for all role scenarios
- [ ] Document permission matrix in technical documentation

### Security Review

**Strengths**:
- Permissions enforced at API level (not just UI)
- Proper use of tRPC middleware for permission checks
- Clear separation between UI hiding and actual security

**Concerns**:
- TypeScript errors could mask security issues
- Test failures mean permission logic isn't validated
- Missing schema elements could cause runtime failures

### Performance Considerations

- Permission checks execute database query on each API call
- Consider implementing permission caching within session
- Bulk operations properly restricted to admin/owner roles

### Files Modified During Review

None - critical issues prevent safe refactoring

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/2.6-basic-permission-system.yml
Risk Level: **HIGH** - Non-functional due to compilation errors

### Recommended Status

✗ **Changes Required** - Critical issues must be resolved before story can be considered complete

**Immediate Actions Required**:
1. Fix TypeScript compilation errors
2. Add missing database schema elements
3. Fix all failing tests
4. Re-run full test suite after fixes

The permission system architecture is sound, but the implementation has critical issues that prevent it from being production-ready. The story cannot be marked as complete until all compilation errors are resolved and tests are passing.
