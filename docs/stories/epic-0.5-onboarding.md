## üìã Requirements Gathering Needed

### Questions for Product Owner

#### Page Layout & Design
1. **Visual Design**
   - Should it match Isla's branding (blue/indigo gradient)?
   - Full-screen or centered card design?
   - Should we show Isla logo/branding?
   - Any welcome illustrations or icons?

2. **Form Fields for Workspace Creation**
   - Workspace name (required)
   - Workspace slug/URL (auto-generated or manual?)
   - Description field?
   - Industry/use case selection?
   - Team size selection?
   - Timezone selection?

3. **Slug/URL Handling**
   - Auto-generate from workspace name?
   - Allow manual editing?
   - Show real-time availability check?
   - Format: `app.isla.sh/[slug]` or `[slug].isla.sh`?
   - Character restrictions (alphanumeric, hyphens only)?

4. **Validation & Error States**
   - How to show slug already taken?
   - Minimum/maximum length for workspace name?
   - Reserved words to block (admin, api, www, etc.)?
   - Show suggestions for alternative slugs?

5. **Multi-step vs Single Page**
   - All in one page (current implementation)?
   - Or multi-step wizard:
     - Step 1: Welcome & workspace details
     - Step 2: Customization (logo, colors)
     - Step 3: Invite team (skippable)
     - Step 4: Quick tutorial

6. **Additional Options**
   - "Create sample data" checkbox?
   - "Take a quick tour" option?
   - "Import from another service" button?
   - Newsletter/updates opt-in?

7. **Success State**
   - Immediate redirect to workspace?
   - Show success message first?
   - Offer quick tutorial before redirect?
   - Celebration animation?

8. **Edge Cases**
   - User already has workspace (shouldn't see onboarding)
   - User deleted all workspaces (see onboarding again?)
   - User was invited to workspace (skip onboarding?)
   - Multiple browser tabs open during creation?

### Visual References Needed
- Screenshots of similar onboarding flows you like
- Specific design elements to include/avoid
- Brand guidelines (colors, fonts, tone)

### Technical Decisions Needed
1. **Workspace Limits**
   - Max workspaces per user on free plan?
   - Default limits for new workspace (links, clicks, users)?
   - Which plan to assign (free, trial, etc.)?

2. **Post-Creation Setup**
   - Create default folders/tags?
   - Create sample link?
   - Send welcome email?
   - Track in analytics?

## Technical Decisions

### Current Approach
- Removed automatic workspace creation from user.initialize
- Explicit onboarding flow at `/onboarding`
- Simple single-page form initially

### Data Flow
1. User signs up ‚Üí user.initialize (no workspace)
2. Redirect to /dashboard
3. Dashboard checks for workspace
4. No workspace ‚Üí redirect to /onboarding
5. User creates workspace
6. Redirect to /{workspace}/links

### Alternative Approaches Considered
1. **Modal-based**: Show workspace creation in modal (rejected - too cramped)
2. **Auto-create**: Create default workspace automatically (rejected - poor UX)
3. **Wizard**: Multi-step wizard (future enhancement)

---

## Dependencies
- Auth system (Epic 0.2) ‚úÖ
- Workspace model (Epic 0.3) ‚úÖ
- Workspace creation API ‚úÖ
- Routing structure ‚úÖ

## Blockers
- None currently

## Risks
- Slug collision handling needs to be robust
- First impression is critical - needs polish

---

## Notes for PM

### MVP (Story 0.5.1 & 0.5.2)
- Basic onboarding page ‚úÖ
- Workspace creation with validation
- Proper redirects
- **Time**: 4 hours

### Enhanced Experience (Story 0.5.3-0.5.6)
- Multi-step process
- Tutorial
- Templates
- **Time**: Additional 9 hours

### Recommendation
Ship MVP first, then enhance based on user feedback. The basic flow is functional but could benefit from polish before launch.
