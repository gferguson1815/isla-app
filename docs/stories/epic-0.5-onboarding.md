- **Progress indicator**: Visual stepper for multi-step onboarding
- **Welcome tutorial**: Interactive guided tour for first-time users
- **Sample data**: Pre-populated templates and examples
- **Team invitations**: Invite team members during onboarding
- **Workspace customization**: Logo and color scheme selection

These can be considered for future iterations based on user feedback and priorities.

## Technical Decisions

### Current Approach

- Removed automatic workspace creation from user.initialize
- Explicit onboarding flow at `/onboarding`
- Simple single-page form initially

### Data Flow

1. User signs up â†’ user.initialize (no workspace)
2. Redirect to /dashboard
3. Dashboard checks for workspace
4. No workspace â†’ redirect to /onboarding
5. User creates workspace
6. Redirect to /{workspace}/links

### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Modal-based**: Show workspace creation in modal (rejected - too cramped)
2. **Auto-create**: Create default workspace automatically (rejected - poor UX)
3. **Wizard**: Multi-step wizard (future enhancement)

## Dependencies

- Auth system (Epic 0.2) âœ…
- Workspace model (Epic 0.3) âœ…
- Workspace creation API âœ…
- Routing structure âœ…

## Blockers

- None currently

## Risks

- Slug collision handling needs to be robust
- First impression is critical - needs polish

## Notes for PM

### MVP (Story 0.5.1 & 0.5.2)

- Basic onboarding page âœ…
- Workspace creation with validation
- Proper redirects
- **Time**: 4 hours

### Enhanced Experience (Story 0.5.3-0.5.6)

- Multi-step process
- Tutorial
- Templates
- **Time**: Additional 9 hours

### Recommendation

Ship MVP first, then enhance based on user feedback. The basic flow is functional but could benefit from polish before launch.

## Test Cases

1. New user signup â†’ redirect to onboarding
2. Create workspace with taken slug â†’ error message
3. Create workspace successfully â†’ redirect to workspace
4. User with workspace â†’ skip onboarding
5. User deletes last workspace â†’ redirect to onboarding
