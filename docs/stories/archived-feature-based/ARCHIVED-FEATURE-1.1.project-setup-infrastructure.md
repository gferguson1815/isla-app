# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Infrastructure

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui,
**so that** we have a modern, type-safe foundation for rapid development.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Next.js 14+ project initialized with App Router and TypeScript configuration
2. Tailwind CSS configured with custom design tokens matching brand guidelines
3. shadcn/ui installed with base components (Button, Input, Card, Dialog, Table)
4. Monorepo structure established using Turborepo with packages for shared utilities
5. Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore and branch protection rules
6. Prettier and ESLint configured with pre-commit hooks via Husky
7. Project runs locally with `pnpm dev` and builds successfully with `pnpm build`
8. pnpm workspace configured with proper package.json and pnpm-workspace.yaml

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-18

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The project setup and infrastructure implementation is **excellent**. The foundation has been laid with modern best practices:
- Next.js 15.5.3 (exceeds 14.2+ requirement)
- TypeScript 5.9.2 properly configured
- Tailwind CSS v4 with custom design tokens
- shadcn/ui components successfully integrated
- Turborepo monorepo structure properly established
- Code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier, Husky) configured correctly

### Refactoring Performed

None required - the implementation is clean and follows current best practices.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Component naming follows PascalCase, configuration in kebab-case
- Project Structure: ✗ Missing src/ directory - project uses app/ at root level (Next.js 15 pattern)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Placeholder script present, testing setup deferred to story 1.2
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Verified all build scripts work correctly (dev, build, lint, typecheck)
- [x] Confirmed Husky pre-commit hooks with lint-staged integration
- [x] Validated Turborepo pipeline configuration
- [ ] Note: src/ directory not used - this is acceptable with Next.js 15 App Router pattern
- [ ] Consider adding a CONTRIBUTING.md for developer onboarding
- [ ] Add environment variable examples in .env.example file

### Security Review

**No security concerns found.** Good practices observed:
- .gitignore properly configured to exclude sensitive files
- Environment variables properly excluded from version control
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials

### Performance Considerations

**Excellent foundation for performance:**
- Turborepo for efficient monorepo builds with caching
- Next.js 15 with optimized production builds
- Tailwind CSS v4 with JIT compilation
- Build successfully generates optimized static pages

### Files Modified During Review

None - all implementations meet quality standards.

### Gate Status

Gate: **PASS** → docs/qa/gates/1.1-project-setup-infrastructure.yml
Risk profile: Low risk - foundation setup with no critical issues
NFR assessment: All NFRs satisfied for initial setup

### Recommended Status

✓ **Ready for Done** - All acceptance criteria met with excellent implementation quality.
