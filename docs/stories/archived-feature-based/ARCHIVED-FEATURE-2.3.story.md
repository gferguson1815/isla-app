## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 3.3 (UTM Parameter Management) was successfully completed. No blocking issues or dependencies from that story affect this implementation.

### Data Models
**Folder Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Folder Model]
- Already exists in Prisma schema at prisma/schema.prisma:80-95
- Key fields: id (UUID), workspace_id, name, parent_id (for nesting), level (depth tracking)
- Relationships: Belongs to Workspace, Self-referential for parent/children, Has many Links
- TypeScript interface defined in data-models.md:280-294

**Link Model Updates** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Link Model]
- folder_id field already exists (nullable UUID)
- Links can belong to one folder via folder_id foreign key

### API Specifications
**tRPC Router Pattern** [Source: Observed from app/server/routers/workspace.ts]
- Use protectedProcedure for authenticated endpoints
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Rate limiting for creation operations
- Transaction support for complex operations
- Consistent error handling with TRPCError

### Component Specifications
**UI Framework** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- shadcn/ui components (already in use)
- Lucide React for icons
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- react-hook-form for form management
- Zod for validation

**Component Location** [Source: Observed project structure]
- Folder components: components/folders/
- Shared UI components: components/ui/

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- Router: `app/server/routers/folder.ts`
- Components: `components/folders/`
- Types: `packages/shared/src/types/folder.ts`
- Tests: `app/server/routers/__tests__/folder.test.ts`, `components/folders/__tests__/`

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Unit tests in `__tests__` folders adjacent to code
- Use Vitest for all testing
- Component tests for UI components
- Integration tests for tRPC procedures
- E2E tests in tests/e2e/ for critical workflows

### Technical Constraints
- PostgreSQL with Supabase [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Maximum 3 levels of folder nesting (business requirement)
- Workspace-based multi-tenancy must be enforced
- Drag-and-drop library: Consider @dnd-kit (modern, accessible)

### Project Structure Notes
- Using App Router in Next.js 14.2+
- tRPC for type-safe API layer
- Prisma as ORM
- All database operations through Prisma client

## Testing

### Test File Locations
- Router tests: `app/server/routers/__tests__/folder.test.ts`
- Component tests: `components/folders/__tests__/`
- Integration tests: Run with `pnpm test:integration`
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/folders.spec.ts`

### Testing Standards
- Use Vitest for unit and integration tests
- Use Testing Library for component tests
- Mock tRPC procedures in component tests
- Use test database for integration tests
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-19

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates strong architectural design with comprehensive folder management capabilities. The code follows established patterns and implements all acceptance criteria effectively. Notable strengths include proper workspace-based multi-tenancy, recursive CTE usage for hierarchical operations, and atomic transaction support for complex operations.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: app/server/routers/__tests__/folder.test.ts
  - **Change**: Fixed UUID format validation issues in test data
  - **Why**: Tests were failing due to invalid UUID strings not conforming to standard UUID v4 format
  - **How**: Replaced mock IDs with properly formatted UUIDs and fixed mock references from workspace_members to workspace_memberships

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows established naming conventions, uses proper error handling with TRPCError
- Project Structure: ✓ Components properly organized in components/folders/, router in correct location
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Unit tests present, follows AAA pattern, uses Vitest as specified
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed UUID validation issues in test suite (app/server/routers/__tests__/folder.test.ts)
- [x] Corrected mock service references for workspace membership checks
- [ ] Consider adding integration tests for drag-and-drop functionality
- [ ] Add E2E tests for complete folder workflow as specified in task list
- [ ] Consider implementing folder move operation logging for audit trail
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for recursive CTE operations with large folder trees

### Security Review

**Strong Points:**
- Proper workspace membership validation on all operations
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Cycle detection prevents infinite loops in folder hierarchies

**Areas Reviewed:**
- No exposed sensitive data in error messages
- Proper authorization checks before all CRUD operations
- Rate limiting consideration noted but commented out (should be enabled in production)

### Performance Considerations

**Optimizations Identified:**
- Recursive CTEs used efficiently for hierarchical operations
- Proper indexing assumed on workspace_id and parent_id columns
- buildFolderTree function uses O(n) algorithm for tree construction

**Recommendations:**
- Monitor performance with deep folder structures (approaching 3-level limit)
- Consider caching folder tree structure for frequently accessed workspaces
- Add database indexes if not present: `CREATE INDEX idx_folders_workspace_parent ON folders(workspace_id, parent_id);`

### Files Modified During Review

- app/server/routers/__tests__/folder.test.ts (fixed UUID validation and mock references)

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/2.3-folder-organization-system.yml
Risk profile: Generated inline assessment
NFR assessment: Validated inline

### Recommended Status

[✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above]
(Story owner decides final status)

**Key Concerns:**
1. Missing E2E tests as specified in the story tasks
2. Rate limiting commented out in creation procedure
3. Integration tests for drag-and-drop not yet implemented

These items should be addressed before marking as Done, though the core functionality is solid.
