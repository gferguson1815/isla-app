## Dev Notes

### Data Models
Based on the Workspace and WorkspaceMembership models from [Source: architecture/data-models.md#workspace-model]:

**Workspace Model:**
- id: UUID - Unique identifier
- name: string - Workspace display name
- slug: string - URL-friendly identifier
- plan: 'free' | 'pro' | 'business' - Subscription tier
- billingCycleStart: DateTime - Subscription start date
- stripeCustomerId: string? - Stripe reference
- stripeSubscriptionId: string? - Active subscription
- createdAt: DateTime - Workspace creation
- limits: JSON - Plan-specific limits (links, users, etc.)
- isSuspended: boolean - Suspension status
- suspensionReason: string? - Suspension reason
- isVerified: boolean - Trusted workspace status
- customLimits: JSON? - Admin overrides

**WorkspaceMembership Model:**
- id: UUID - Unique identifier
- userId: UUID - Reference to User
- workspaceId: UUID - Reference to Workspace
- role: 'owner' | 'admin' | 'member' - Permission level
- joinedAt: DateTime - Membership start date

### Technology Stack Context
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

- Types: `packages/shared/types/workspace.ts`

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Type Sharing: Define types in packages/shared and import from there
- API Calls: Use tRPC client, never direct HTTP calls
- Environment Variables: Access through config objects only
- Error Handling: All API routes must use standard error handler
- State Updates: Use proper state management patterns (Zustand)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]
- Component Tests: `src/components/workspace/__tests__/`
- API Tests: `src/server/routers/__tests__/workspace.test.ts`

- Test Commands: `pnpm test` for unit tests, `pnpm test:integration` for API tests

### Previous Story Context
No previous stories found for Epic 2. This is the first story implementing team collaboration features.

### Technical Constraints
- Workspace slug must be globally unique across platform
- URL structure must follow pattern: app.domain.com/w/[workspace-slug]
- First workspace created automatically on signup (role: 'owner')
- Soft delete implementation required for workspace deletion
- All existing links must be migrated to a default workspace context

## Testing

### Unit Tests Required
- Workspace creation validation logic
- Slug generation and uniqueness checking
- Workspace switching state management
- Form validation schemas

### Integration Tests Required
- Workspace CRUD API endpoints
- WorkspaceMembership relationship handling
- Database migration verification
- Link-workspace association updates

### E2E Tests Required
- Complete workspace creation flow
- Workspace switcher functionality
- Settings page operations
- Workspace deletion confirmation

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-19

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Critical Issues Found:** The implementation shows significant promise but has critical test infrastructure failures that prevent proper validation. The API router implementation is sound architecturally, but tests are failing due to missing Prisma context mocking.

**Type System Alignment:** Excellent - Types are properly defined in packages/shared and used consistently across the codebase. The workspace router correctly maps between Prisma snake_case and TypeScript camelCase conventions.

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: app/server/routers/workspace.ts
- **Change**: Fixed hard delete implementation with TODO comment for soft delete
- **Why**: Current implementation uses hard delete but story requires soft delete capability
- **How**: Added documentation note that production should implement soft delete with deleted_at timestamp

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ (Follows type sharing, tRPC usage, proper validation)
- Project Structure: ✓ (Files in correct locations per source tree)
- Testing Strategy: ✗ (Tests exist but infrastructure setup is incomplete)
- All ACs Met: ⚠️ (Implementation appears complete but tests failing prevent verification)

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Documented hard delete vs soft delete discrepancy in router comments
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Fix test Prisma context mocking - tests completely failing
- [ ] Implement proper soft delete with deleted_at field in schema migration
- [ ] Add component tests for WorkspaceCreationModal and other UI components
- [ ] Add E2E tests for complete workspace flows
- [ ] Implement user signup auto-workspace creation (AC 4)
- [ ] Add workspace-specific link filtering validation
- [ ] Security review of workspace membership authorization

### Security Review

**Concerns Found:**
- Authorization checks are present but need verification through working tests
- Hard delete implementation could cause data loss (should be soft delete)
- Need to verify workspace isolation prevents cross-workspace data access

### Performance Considerations

- Slug uniqueness checking could be optimized with database indices (already present in schema)
- No caching strategy for workspace lookups yet
- Query optimization needed for workspace listing with counts

### Files Modified During Review

- app/server/routers/workspace.ts (added documentation comments)

### Gate Status

Gate: FAIL → docs/qa/gates/2.1-workspace-creation-and-management.yml
Risk profile: docs/qa/assessments/2.1-risk-20250919.md
NFR assessment: docs/qa/assessments/2.1-nfr-20250919.md

### Recommended Status

[✗ Changes Required - Critical test infrastructure must be fixed before deployment]

**Blocking Issues:**
1. All tests failing due to improper Prisma mocking setup
2. Hard delete vs soft delete implementation mismatch
3. Missing user signup auto-workspace creation

**Note:** Implementation quality is high, but test failures prevent verification of critical functionality. Must resolve test infrastructure before proceeding to Done.
