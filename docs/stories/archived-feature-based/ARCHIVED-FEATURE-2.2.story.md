## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.1: Workspace and WorkspaceMembership models are fully implemented with proper role system ('owner' | 'admin' | 'member'). tRPC workspace router is established and all link operations include workspace context.

### Data Models
Based on WorkspaceMembership model from [Source: architecture/data-models.md#workspacemembership-model]:

**New WorkspaceInvitation Model Required:**
- id: UUID - Unique identifier
- workspaceId: UUID - Reference to target workspace
- email: string - Invitee email address
- role: 'admin' | 'member' - Assigned role (cannot invite as 'owner')
- token: string - Secure invitation token
- invitedBy: UUID - Admin who sent invitation
- createdAt: DateTime - Invitation timestamp
- expiresAt: DateTime - Token expiration (24-48 hours)
- acceptedAt: DateTime? - Acceptance timestamp
- revokedAt: DateTime? - Revocation timestamp

**Existing WorkspaceMembership Model:**
- id: UUID - Unique identifier
- userId: UUID - Reference to User
- workspaceId: UUID - Reference to Workspace
- role: 'owner' | 'admin' | 'member' - Permission level
- joinedAt: DateTime - Membership start date

### Technology Stack Context
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Frontend Framework: Next.js 14.2+ with App Router
- Backend: tRPC 10.45+ for type-safe API layer
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL with Prisma 5.9+ ORM
- Email Service: Resend for transactional emails with React templates
- Authentication: Supabase Auth 2.0+ with magic links
- UI Components: shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS 3.4+
- Form Handling: react-hook-form 7.49+ with Zod 3.22+ validation

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
Extend existing tRPC workspace router with new procedures:
- sendInvitations(emails: string[], role: 'admin' | 'member')
- acceptInvitation(token: string)
- revokeInvitation(invitationId: string)
- resendInvitation(invitationId: string)
- getPendingInvitations(workspaceId: string)
- removeWorkspaceMember(userId: string, workspaceId: string)

### Email Service Integration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use Resend for invitation emails with React email templates
- Environment strategy: Local (Preview) → Dev (Test) → Prod (Live)
- Magic link format: app.domain.com/invite/[token]
- Template should include workspace name, inviter name, and clear CTA

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- API Routes: `src/server/routers/workspace.ts` (extend existing)
- Components: `src/components/workspace/` directory
- Email Templates: `src/emails/` directory for Resend templates
- Prisma Schema: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Pages: `src/app/invite/[token]/page.tsx` for invitation acceptance
- Types: `packages/shared/types/workspace.ts` (extend existing)

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Type Sharing: Define types in packages/shared and import from there
- API Calls: Use tRPC client, never direct HTTP calls
- Environment Variables: Access through config objects only
- Error Handling: All API routes must use standard error handler
- State Updates: Use proper state management patterns (Zustand)

### Security Requirements
- Invitation tokens must be cryptographically secure (crypto.randomBytes)
- Tokens should expire within 24-48 hours
- Validate email addresses before sending invitations
- Only 'owner' and 'admin' roles can send invitations
- Rate limiting on invitation sending to prevent abuse
- Proper authorization checks for all team management operations

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]
- Component Tests: `src/components/workspace/__tests__/`
- API Tests: `src/server/routers/__tests__/workspace.test.ts` (extend existing)
- E2E Tests: `tests/e2e/workspace-invitations.spec.ts`
- Email Tests: Mock Resend service for invitation sending
- Test Commands: `pnpm test` for unit tests, `pnpm test:integration` for API tests

### Technical Constraints
- Invitation emails must be sent asynchronously to avoid UI blocking
- Handle existing user vs new user signup flows differently
- Prevent duplicate invitations to same email for same workspace
- Graceful handling of expired or invalid invitation tokens
- Workspace owners cannot be removed or have role changed
- Must maintain workspace member limits based on plan constraints

## Testing

### Unit Tests Required
- Invitation token generation and validation
- Email validation and parsing logic
- Role permission checking for invitations
- Invitation expiration logic
- Member removal authorization

### Integration Tests Required
- Complete invitation flow API endpoints
- Email service integration with Resend
- Database relationship handling for invitations
- Supabase Auth integration for signup/login from invitations
- WorkspaceMembership creation from accepted invitations

### E2E Tests Required
- Send invitation to new user flow
- Send invitation to existing user flow
- Accept invitation and workspace access
- Revoke and resend invitation functionality
- Remove team member flow with confirmation

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-19

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The team member invitation system is well-implemented with solid architecture and proper separation of concerns. The implementation follows a secure token-based invitation flow with appropriate role-based access control. All 7 acceptance criteria have been addressed with corresponding implementation. The code demonstrates good practices in TypeScript typing, component composition, and API design.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was required. The implementation is clean and follows established patterns.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows architecture patterns, uses shared types from packages/shared
- Project Structure: ✓ Components properly organized, API endpoints in correct locations
- Testing Strategy: ✗ **CRITICAL GAP** - No tests found for invitation functionality
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria have corresponding implementations

### Requirements Traceability

**Coverage Analysis:**
- AC1 (Invite form accepts emails): ✓ InviteMembersModal with email validation
- AC2 (Magic link emails): ✓ sendInvitations mutation + email service (requires RESEND_API_KEY)
- AC3 (Pending invitations list): ✓ PendingInvitationsList component + getPendingInvitations query
- AC4 (New user signup from link): ✓ AcceptInvitationPage handles auth flow
- AC5 (Existing users accept): ✓ acceptInvitation mutation with workspace access
- AC6 (Team members list): ✓ TeamMembersList component with role badges
- AC7 (Remove member): ✓ removeWorkspaceMember mutation with confirmation

### Test Architecture Assessment

**CRITICAL GAP IDENTIFIED:**
- **NO TESTS IMPLEMENTED** despite all tasks marked as completed
- No unit tests for invitation service functions found
- No integration tests for invitation API endpoints found
- No component tests for invitation UI components found
- No E2E tests for complete invitation flow found
- Existing workspace.test.ts lacks invitation endpoint coverage

### Security Review

**Strengths:**
- ✓ Secure token generation using crypto.randomBytes(32)
- ✓ 48-hour token expiration implemented
- ✓ Role-based access control (only owner/admin can invite)
- ✓ Email validation before sending
- ✓ Proper authorization checks for all operations

**Concerns:**
- ⚠️ No rate limiting on invitation sending (potential abuse vector)
- ⚠️ No validation of maximum invitations per time period
- ⚠️ Token stored in plain text in database (consider hashing)

### Performance Considerations

- ✓ Asynchronous email sending prevents UI blocking
- ✓ Duplicate invitation prevention reduces unnecessary operations
- ✓ Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- ⚠️ No pagination for pending invitations list (potential issue at scale)

### Non-Functional Requirements Validation

**Security:** CONCERNS
- Missing rate limiting on invitation endpoints
- Token storage could be improved with hashing
- No audit logging for invitation actions

**Performance:** PASS
- Async email handling prevents blocking
- Efficient database queries

**Reliability:** CONCERNS
- Email failures are silently caught but not retried
- No dead letter queue for failed emails
- No monitoring/alerting for invitation failures

**Maintainability:** PASS
- Clean code structure with proper typing
- Good separation of concerns
- Clear component organization

### Technical Debt Identified

1. **Test Coverage Debt** - Complete absence of tests for this feature
2. **Security Hardening** - Rate limiting and token hashing needed
3. **Observability Gap** - No logging or monitoring for invitation flows
4. **Email Reliability** - No retry mechanism for failed emails

### Improvements Checklist

**Immediate (Must Fix):**
- [ ] **Add comprehensive test coverage for all invitation functionality**
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on sendInvitations endpoint
- [ ] Add integration tests for invitation API endpoints
- [ ] Add component tests for UI components
- [ ] Create E2E tests for complete invitation flow

**Future Improvements:**
