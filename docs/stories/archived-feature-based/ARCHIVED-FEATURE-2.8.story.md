# Story 2.8: Subscription Management UI

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** workspace admin,
**I want** to manage my subscription,
**so that** I can control costs and access features.

## Acceptance Criteria

   - Current plan display with renewal date
   - Usage meters (animated progress bars):
     - Team Members: X/Y used
     - Links Created: X/Y used
     - Clicks This Month: X/Y used
   - Next invoice preview
   - Payment method display (last 4 digits)

2. **Plan Selection UI** (Dub.co style):
   ```
   ┌──────────┬───────────┬───────────┐
   │   FREE   │  STARTER  │  GROWTH   │
   │    $0    │   $19/mo  │  $49/mo   │
   ├──────────┼───────────┼───────────┤

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.7 established the billing foundation with:
- Stripe service layer at `/src/server/services/stripe.ts` with all subscription management methods
- tRPC billing router at `/app/server/routers/billing.ts` with procedures for subscription operations
- Database tables: subscriptions, usage_metrics, invoices, payment_methods
- Webhook handler at `/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` for Stripe events
- Environment variables configured: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET

### Data Models
**Workspace Model with Billing Fields** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Workspace Model]:
- plan: 'free' | 'starter' | 'growth' (Note: Architecture shows 'pro'|'business' - using Epic's naming)
- stripeCustomerId: string? - Stripe customer reference
- stripeSubscriptionId: string? - Active subscription ID  
- billingCycleStart: DateTime - Subscription start date
- limits: JSON object with maxLinks, maxUsers, maxClicks, customDomains

**Billing Tables from Story 2.7**:
- subscriptions: id, workspaceId, stripeSubscriptionId, stripePriceId, status, currentPeriodEnd, cancelAtPeriodEnd
- usage_metrics: id, workspaceId, metricType, value, period, createdAt
- invoices: id, workspaceId, stripeInvoiceId, amountDue, amountPaid, status, dueDate
- payment_methods: id, workspaceId, stripePaymentMethodId, type, last4, expiryMonth, expiryYear, isDefault

### API Specifications
**Existing tRPC Procedures from Story 2.7** [Source: Story 2.7 implementation]:
- billing.getSubscription - Fetch current subscription details
- billing.createSubscription - Create new subscription with price tier
- billing.updateSubscription - Change plan (upgrade/downgrade)
- billing.cancelSubscription - Cancel at period end
- billing.getUsageMetrics - Fetch current usage against limits
- billing.getInvoices - Retrieve billing history
- billing.addPaymentMethod - Add new card
- billing.setDefaultPaymentMethod - Update default card

### Component Specifications
**UI Components Following Dub.co Pattern** [Source: architecture/dubco-ux-reference-guide.md]:
- Color palette: Primary #000000, backgrounds #ffffff/#fafafa/#f4f4f5
- Typography: Inter for sans, JetBrains Mono for monospace
- Micro-interactions: 200-300ms transitions, morphing icons, smooth height animations
- Empty states with illustrations and clear CTAs
- Command palette support (CMD+K) for power users
- Mobile-first with bottom sheets and 44px tap targets

**shadcn/ui Components to Use** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Card for pricing tiers
- Dialog for modals
- Button with variants (default, outline, ghost)
- Skeleton for loading states
- Table for billing history
- Form with react-hook-form integration
- Alert for warnings and notifications

### File Locations
Based on [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Future Structure]:
- `/app/workspace/[slug]/billing/page.tsx` - Billing dashboard page (App Router)
- `/components/billing/` - Billing-specific components:
  - PricingCards.tsx
  - UsageMeters.tsx
  - PaymentMethods.tsx
  - BillingHistory.tsx
  - UpgradeModal.tsx
  - DowngradeModal.tsx
  - TrialBanner.tsx
- `/lib/stripe-client.ts` - Client-side Stripe initialization
- `/hooks/useBilling.ts` - Custom hook for billing state

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Test Organization]:
- Component tests: `/components/billing/__tests__/` folder
- Use Vitest 1.2+ framework for all tests
- Testing Library for component testing
- Mock Stripe Elements in tests using @stripe/react-stripe-js test utilities
- Test file naming: `*.test.tsx` for unit tests
- Required test coverage: Unit (60%), Integration (30%)

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack]:
- Next.js 14.2+ with App Router
- TypeScript 5.3+ for type safety
- shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS 3.4+
- Zustand 4.5+ for client state if needed
- tRPC 10.45+ for API calls
- TanStack Query 5.18+ for server state
- Framer Motion for animations
- react-hook-form 7.49+ with Zod 3.22+ validation
- @stripe/stripe-js and @stripe/react-stripe-js for Stripe Elements
- canvas-confetti for success animations
- date-fns 3.3+ for date calculations

### Security Considerations
- Never expose Stripe secret key to client
- Use Stripe Elements for PCI compliance
- Validate all billing operations server-side
- Rate limit subscription changes
- Audit log all billing actions

### Testing

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file location: Adjacent to source in `__tests__` folders
- Framework: Vitest 1.2+ for all tests
- Component tests using Testing Library
- Mock external services (Stripe) in unit tests
- Test responsive breakpoints for mobile/tablet/desktop
- Ensure accessibility compliance (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
