# Story 0.5.3: Workspace Creation Step

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** new user,
**I want** to create my workspace with a name, URL, and logo,
**so that** I can establish my branded space for managing links

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The workspace creation page is accessible at `/onboarding/workspace`
2. The page uses a refined version of the welcome page template:
   - Aurora gradient background concentrated in upper portion (top 40% of viewport)
   - Animated lines/effects stay above the form card area to avoid interference
   - Isla logo positioned above the card (smaller, centered at top of page with padding)
   - Centered white card with form (solid white, no transparency for better readability)
   - "Create your workspace" heading inside card
   - Subheading: "Set up a shared space to manage your links with your team. Learn more."
   - Bottom left: "You're signed in as [email]" with sign out link
   - Bottom right: Help button (reuse from welcome page)
3. Workspace Name field:
   - Required field
   - Accepts any characters (uppercase, lowercase, special characters)
   - Max 50 characters
   - Placeholder: "Acme, Inc."
4. Workspace Slug field:
   - Auto-generates from workspace name in real-time
   - Converts to lowercase, replaces spaces with hyphens, strips special characters
   - Format display: `app.isla.so/[slug]`
   - Editable by user (but only URL-safe characters allowed: a-z, 0-9, hyphens)
   - Real-time availability checking with API call
   - Helper text: "You can change this later in your workspace settings."
   - Min 3, max 30 characters
5. Workspace Logo upload:
   - Required field
   - Upload button with text "Upload image"
   - Shows "Recommended size: 160x160px" helper text
   - Preview uploaded image in place of upload button
   - Supports common image formats (PNG, JPG, SVG)
6. Create workspace button:
   - Black button with white text (matching Dub style)
   - Full width of form
   - Shows loading state while creating
   - Disabled until all fields are valid
7. Field validation:
   - Inline error messages below fields
   - Red border on fields with errors
   - Real-time slug availability checking
   - Reserved slugs blocked: [admin, api, app, www, support, help, docs, blog, status]
8. On successful creation:
   - Create workspace in database
   - Upload logo to Supabase Storage
   - Navigate to next onboarding step
   - Maintain user session throughout

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: 0.5.1 story implementation]
- Aurora Background component already installed and working (needs modification for top-weighted effect)
- HelpWidget component exists and can be reused
- Bottom navigation pattern established (user info left, help right)
- Update card styling: Remove transparency for forms - use `bg-white rounded-2xl shadow-xl p-8`
- Logo component exists but needs smaller sizing when above card
- Loading states use skeleton components

### UI Framework and Components
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Next.js 14.2+ with App Router
- shadcn/ui components (Input, Button, Label)
- Tailwind CSS 3.4+ for styling
- lucide-react 0.32+ for icons
- Use `cn()` utility for conditional classes

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md, current structure]
- Page component: `/app/onboarding/workspace/page.tsx`
- Slug utilities: `/lib/utils/slug.ts` (to be created)
- Tests: `/app/onboarding/workspace/__tests__/page.test.tsx`

### API Specifications
[Source: Existing tRPC patterns, requirements document]
- Create new tRPC procedures:
  - `trpc.workspace.checkSlug.useQuery()` for availability checking
  - `trpc.workspace.create.useMutation()` for workspace creation

### Supabase Storage Implementation
[Source: requirements document - storage requirements]
- Bucket name: 'workspace-logos' (public bucket)
- File structure: `{workspace_id}/logo.{extension}`
- Max file size: 5MB
- Allowed MIME types: image/png, image/jpeg, image/svg+xml, image/webp
- Upload flow:
  1. Create workspace record first (to get workspace_id)
  2. Upload logo using workspace_id in path
  3. Update workspace record with logo URL
- Public URL format: `{SUPABASE_URL}/storage/v1/object/public/workspace-logos/{workspace_id}/logo.{ext}`
- Use Supabase JS client: `supabase.storage.from('workspace-logos').upload()`

### Slug Generation Logic
- Transform examples:
  - "Acme, Inc." → "acme-inc"
  - "Bob's Burgers" → "bobs-burgers"
  - "Test #123!" → "test-123"
  - "New  York  Times" → "new-york-times" (multiple spaces to single hyphen)
- Use existing slug libraries if available (e.g., slugify)
- Ensure idempotency (running transform twice gives same result)

### Component Specifications
[Source: Dub.co screenshot, requirements doc]
- Page layout:
  - Logo: 40px height, positioned ~48px from top of viewport
  - Card: Positioned ~24px below logo
  - Aurora effects: Contained to top 40% of viewport, subtle opacity
- Form card:
  - Solid white background (no transparency)
  - Max width: 448px (28rem)
  - Padding: 32px
  - Border radius: 16px (rounded-2xl)
  - Shadow: shadow-xl for depth
- Form layout: Single column, full width inputs
- Input styling: Rounded borders, gray outline, focus:ring
- Logo upload: Custom button styled like inputs
- Preview: 80x80px rounded image
- Button: Black background, white text, rounded, full width
- Maintain consistent spacing between form elements (16px gap)

### Validation Rules
[Source: requirements document]
- Workspace name: Required, max 50 chars
- Slug: Required, 3-30 chars, lowercase/numbers/hyphens only, globally unique
- Logo: Required, valid image file, max 5MB
- Reserved slugs to block: [admin, api, app, www, support, help, docs, blog, status]

### Technical Constraints
- Page load <2 seconds
- Real-time slug checking with 500ms debounce
- Support dark mode (already handled by Aurora/card pattern)
- Maintain user session throughout onboarding
- Handle network failures gracefully

### Default Workspace Settings
[Source: requirements document]
When creating workspace, apply these defaults:
```javascript
{
  plan: 'free',
  limits: {
    max_links: 100,
    max_clicks: 5000,
    max_users: 1,
    max_domains: 1,
  },
  features: {
    custom_domains: false,
    api_access: false,
    analytics: true,
    team_members: false,
  },
  settings: {
    timezone: 'auto', // Detect from browser
    week_starts: 'monday',
    date_format: 'MM/DD/YYYY',
  }
}
```

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation quality with comprehensive coverage of all acceptance criteria. The workspace creation page demonstrates professional-grade development practices with proper error handling, real-time validation, and responsive design. The Aurora background modification successfully concentrates effects in the top 40% as required, and the form validation is robust with appropriate user feedback.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `app/onboarding/workspace/page.tsx`
  - **Change**: Removed unused Input import and variables (slugCheckData, data)
  - **Why**: Cleanup unused imports to improve code clarity and pass linting
  - **How**: Removed unnecessary imports and destructured variables

- **File**: `app/onboarding/workspace/page.tsx`
  - **Change**: Added ESLint disable comment for img element
  - **Why**: Logo preview requires img element for file preview functionality
  - **How**: Added specific disable comment with explanation

- **File**: `app/onboarding/workspace/__tests__/page.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed test selectors to match actual page labels
  - **Why**: Tests were failing due to label text mismatches ("Workspace Name" vs "Workspace name")
  - **How**: Updated all test selectors to use correct lowercase labels and fixed navigation expectation

- **File**: `app/onboarding/workspace/__tests__/page.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Improved TypeScript types for mocks and removed unused imports
