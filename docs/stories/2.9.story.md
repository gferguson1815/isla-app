# Story 2.9: Usage Limits & Enforcement

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** system,
**I want** to enforce subscription limits,
**so that** users upgrade when needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Soft Limits (Warnings)**:
   - 80% usage triggers warning banner
   - Email notification to admin
   - Upgrade CTA in warning

2. **Hard Limits (Blocking)**:
   ```typescript
   // Link Creation Check
   if (workspace.linkCount >= plan.maxLinks) {
     return {
       error: "Link limit reached",
       action: "upgrade",
       currentPlan: plan.name,
       suggestedPlan: getNextTier(plan)
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - Clicks always tracked (never lose data)
   - Analytics view-only when over limit
   - Cannot invite users over limit
   - Cannot create links over limit

4. **Usage Tracking**:
   - Real-time counters in Redis
   - Daily sync to database
   - Monthly reset for click limits
   - Permanent count for links/users

5. **Upgrade Prompts**:
   - Inline CTAs when action blocked
   - Modal with plan comparison
   - One-click upgrade flow
   - Success removes all blocks

6. **Admin Overrides**:
   - Support can grant temporary increases
   - Special customer exceptions
   - Beta user unlimited access
   - VIP customer flags

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.8 implementation:
- Stripe integration is already set up and working with payment processing
- Billing UI components are in `/components/billing/` directory
- Fixed tRPC import paths should be '@/lib/trpc/client' not '@/lib/trpc'
- Framer Motion is installed and used for animations
- Canvas-confetti is available for success animations

### Data Models

**Workspace Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Workspace]:
```typescript
interface Workspace {
  plan: "free" | "pro" | "business";
  limits: {
    maxLinks: number;
    maxUsers: number;
    maxClicks: number;
    customDomains: boolean;
  };
  customLimits?: Record<string, number> | null;
}
```

**Platform Limits Configuration** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#PlatformConfig]:
```typescript
interface PlatformLimits {
  free: {
    maxLinks: number;
    maxWorkspaces: number;
    maxTeamMembers: number;
    maxClicksPerMonth: number;
  };
  pro: {
    maxLinks: number;
    maxWorkspaces: number;
    maxTeamMembers: number;
    maxClicksPerMonth: number;
  };
}
```

**Click Event Model** [Source: architecture/architecture.md#ClickEvent]:
```typescript
interface ClickEvent {
  id: string;
  link_id: string;
  visitor_id: string;
  created_at: Date;
  // Additional fields for analytics
}
```

### API Specifications

**Error Response Format** [Source: architecture/architecture.md#Error-Handling-Strategy]:
```typescript
interface ApiError {
  error: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    details?: Record<string, any>;
    timestamp: string;
    requestId: string;
  };
}
```

**tRPC Error Handling** [Source: architecture/architecture.md#backend-error-handling]:
- Use TRPCError with appropriate codes (FORBIDDEN for limits, CONFLICT for duplicates)
- Include structured error details for client-side handling
- Return upgrade suggestions in error details

### Component Specifications

**UI Components to Use** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- shadcn/ui Alert for warning banners
- shadcn/ui Dialog for upgrade modals
- shadcn/ui Progress for usage meters
- shadcn/ui Button with variants for CTAs
- Framer Motion for animation effects

### File Locations

Based on [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md] and existing patterns:
- `/packages/api/src/middleware/usage-limits.ts` - Usage limit checking middleware
- `/packages/api/src/services/usage-tracking.ts` - Usage tracking service
- `/lib/redis.ts` - Redis client configuration
- `/lib/usage-limits.ts` - Client-side usage utilities
- `/hooks/useUsageMetrics.ts` - React hook for usage data
- `/components/usage/WarningBanner.tsx` - 80% warning banner
- `/components/billing/UpgradePrompt.tsx` - Inline upgrade CTAs
- `/components/billing/PlanComparisonModal.tsx` - Plan comparison modal
- `/app/admin/workspaces/[id]/limits/page.tsx` - Admin override UI

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Test Organization]:
- Test Framework: Vitest 1.2+ for all tests
- Test file naming: `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx`
- Test locations:
  - `/packages/api/src/middleware/__tests__/usage-limits.test.ts`
  - `/packages/api/src/services/__tests__/usage-tracking.test.ts`
  - `/components/usage/__tests__/` for component tests
  - `/components/billing/__tests__/` for billing component tests
- Use Testing Library for component testing
- Mock Redis client in tests using vi.mock
- Required coverage: Unit (60%), Integration (30%)
- Test scenarios: soft limits, hard limits, admin overrides, Redis failures

### Technical Constraints

**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Next.js 14.2+ with App Router
- TypeScript 5.3+ for type safety
- tRPC 10.45+ for type-safe API
- Upstash Redis (latest) for real-time counters
- Upstash Ratelimit (latest) for API protection
- Supabase for database with Row Level Security
- TanStack Query 5.18+ for server state
- Zustand 4.5+ for client state if needed
- shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS 3.4+
- Framer Motion for animations

**Redis Configuration** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Provider: Upstash Redis (edge-distributed)
- Purpose: Real-time usage counters and caching
- Environment: Skip locally, Cloud for dev/prod
- Key patterns: `workspace:{id}:links`, `workspace:{id}:clicks:{YYYY-MM}`

**Database Considerations** [Source: architecture/architecture.md#database-schema]:
- Use partitioned tables for click_events (by month)
- Materialized views for aggregated stats
- Row Level Security policies for workspace access
- Indexes on workspace_id and created_at for performance

### Security Considerations

- Never expose internal usage data to unauthorized users
- Validate workspace membership before showing usage metrics
- Rate limit admin override endpoints to prevent abuse
- Log all admin overrides for audit trail
- Use Row Level Security for database-level enforcement

## Testing

### Test File Locations
- `/packages/api/src/middleware/__tests__/usage-limits.test.ts`
- `/packages/api/src/services/__tests__/usage-tracking.test.ts`
- `/components/usage/__tests__/WarningBanner.test.tsx`
- `/components/billing/__tests__/UpgradePrompt.test.tsx`
- `/e2e/usage-limits.test.ts`

### Test Standards
- Use Vitest 1.2+ framework
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external services (Redis, Stripe, Email)
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Include edge cases (exactly at limit, 1 over limit)

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns
- Vitest for unit and integration tests
- Testing Library for component tests
- Playwright for E2E tests (if applicable)
- vi.mock() for mocking dependencies
- Test data factories for consistent test data

### Specific Testing Requirements for This Story
1. Test Redis fallback when Redis is unavailable
2. Test monthly reset logic at month boundaries
3. Test concurrent usage updates (race conditions)
4. Test all plan tiers (free, starter, growth)
5. Test admin override scenarios
6. Test graceful degradation for each feature
7. Test upgrade flow removes all blocks
8. Verify clicks are never lost due to limits
