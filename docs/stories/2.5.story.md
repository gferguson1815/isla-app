## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

Story 2.4 (Tagging and Filtering) successfully implemented:

- Zustand stores for state management (can reuse pattern for command state)
- shadcn/ui Command component usage (for tag autocomplete - similar to command palette needs)
- Keyboard navigation patterns (Tab, Enter, Backspace handling)

Key learnings:

- shadcn/ui components work well for complex interactions
- localStorage is effective for user preferences
- Global state management with Zustand is established pattern

### Data Models

No new data models required for this story. Will utilize existing:

- Workspace model for workspace switcher [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Workspace Model]
- Link model for quick create [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Link Model]
- User model for navigation context [Source: architecture/data-models.md#User Model]

### API Specifications

**tRPC Procedures to Use** [Source: Observed from app/server/routers/]

- `workspace.list` - For workspace switcher
- `link.create` - For quick link creation
- `link.list` - For search functionality
- No new tRPC procedures needed for this story

### Component Specifications

**UI Framework** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- cmdk library for command palette (same as Dub.co uses)
- shadcn/ui components for UI elements
- Lucide React for icons
- Tailwind CSS for styling

**State Management** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Zustand for command palette state
- React Context for keyboard shortcuts provider
- localStorage for user preferences and history

### File Locations

Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md and observed structure]:

- Navigation: `components/navigation/GlobalNav.tsx`, `components/navigation/Breadcrumbs.tsx`
- Command: `components/command/CommandPalette.tsx`
- Search: `components/search/UniversalSearch.tsx`
- Quick Create: `components/links/QuickCreateDialog.tsx`
- Hooks: `hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts`
- Libraries: `lib/command-registry.ts`
- Stores: `lib/stores/command-store.ts` (if needed)
- Tests: Component `__tests__` folders, `tests/e2e/navigation.spec.ts`

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- Unit tests with Vitest in `__tests__` folders
- Component tests using Testing Library
- E2E tests with Playwright for critical user flows
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Test files co-located with source files in `__tests__` directories

### Technical Constraints

- Must work across all modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
- Keyboard shortcuts must not conflict with browser defaults
- Command palette must be performant with 1000+ items
- Mobile responsive with touch-friendly interactions
- Accessibility: Full keyboard navigation, screen reader support

### Performance Considerations

- Lazy load command palette component (dynamic import)
- Debounce search input (300ms delay)
- Virtual scrolling for long command lists
- Cache search results for 5 minutes
- Use React.memo for expensive components

### Implementation Notes

- cmdk library provides built-in virtualization and keyboard navigation
- Fuse.js for fuzzy search provides typo tolerance
- Global keyboard listeners should use useEffect with cleanup
- Command registry should be extensible for future commands
- Consider using Radix UI's Dialog primitive for command palette container

### Project Structure Notes

- Using App Router in Next.js 14.2+
- All components use TypeScript with proper type definitions
- Follow existing patterns from Stories 2.1-2.4
- Consistent with Tailwind CSS utility classes approach
