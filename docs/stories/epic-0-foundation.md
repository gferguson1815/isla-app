## Critical Path Items for Epic 1

### MUST HAVE before Links Page:
1. **Workspace URL routing** - Links page needs `/[workspace]/links`
2. **Workspace context** - Need to know which workspace we're in
3. **Navigation to Links page** - Link in nav must work

### NICE TO HAVE but not blocking:
1. Full navigation panel switching
2. All other nav items
3. Perfect styling

---

## Recommendation

### Option A: Fix Critical Items First (Recommended)
**Time**: 4-6 hours
1. Implement `/[workspace]/links` routing
2. Add workspace context provider
3. Ensure Links navigation works
4. Then proceed with Epic 1

### Option B: Build Links Page at Current URL
**Time**: 0 hours (start now)
1. Build at `/links` temporarily
2. Add workspace routing later
3. Risk: Rework needed

### Option C: Complete All of Epic 0
**Time**: 1-2 days
1. Fix all navigation
2. Perfect the workspace system
3. Risk: Delays Links page

---

1. [x] Workspace URL routing (`/[workspace]/links`) - COMPLETE
2. [x] Workspace context available in pages - COMPLETE
