## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 2.3 (Folder Organization System) successfully implemented:
- Bulk selection system for links (can be reused for bulk tag operations)
- Drag-and-drop functionality using @dnd-kit
- Workspace-based multi-tenancy patterns
- UI components using shadcn/ui patterns

Key learnings:
- Use workspace_memberships (not workspace_members) for permission checks
- Zustand store pattern works well for UI state management
- shadcn/ui Command component is ideal for autocomplete features

### Data Models

**Link Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Link Model]
- Already has tags field: `tags: string[]` - array of tag strings
- Located in Prisma schema at appropriate location
- TypeScript interface shows tags as string array

**New Tag Model** (to be created)
```typescript
interface Tag {
  id: string;
  workspaceId: string;
  name: string;
  color?: string | null; // Hex color for visual identification
  usageCount: number; // Cached count of links using this tag
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### API Specifications

**tRPC Router Pattern** [Source: Observed from app/server/routers/workspace.ts and folder.ts]
- Use protectedProcedure for authenticated endpoints
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Use transactions for operations affecting multiple records
- Consistent error handling with TRPCError
- Workspace membership validation pattern already established

### Component Specifications

**UI Framework** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- shadcn/ui components (Command, Combobox, Badge for tags)
- Lucide React for icons (Tag, X icons)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- react-hook-form for form management
- Zod for validation

**State Management** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Zustand for filter state management
- TanStack Query (via tRPC) for server state

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- Router: `app/server/routers/tag.ts`
- Components: `components/tags/`
- Types: `packages/shared/src/types/tag.ts`
- Page: `app/(dashboard)/[workspace]/tags/page.tsx`
- Store: `lib/stores/tag-filter-store.ts`
- Tests: `app/server/routers/__tests__/tag.test.ts`, `components/tags/__tests__/`

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Unit tests with Vitest in `__tests__` folders
- Component tests using Testing Library
- Integration tests for tRPC procedures
- E2E tests in tests/e2e/ for critical workflows
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

### Technical Constraints
- PostgreSQL array type for tags field (already in use)
- Maximum 10 tags per link (business constraint for UI clarity)
- Tag names should be case-insensitive for matching but preserve original case
- Workspace isolation must be enforced for all tag operations
- Consider indexing tags column for performance: GIN index for array contains queries

### Performance Considerations
- Tags are stored denormalized in links table for query performance
- Separate tags table maintains normalized tag list with counts
- Use database triggers or application logic to keep usage counts in sync
- Consider caching popular tags in Redis for autocomplete

### Project Structure Notes
- Using App Router in Next.js 14.2+
- tRPC for type-safe API layer
- Prisma as ORM with PostgreSQL
- All database operations through Prisma client
- Consistent with patterns established in Stories 2.1-2.3

## Testing

### Test File Locations
- Router tests: `app/server/routers/__tests__/tag.test.ts`
- Component tests: `components/tags/__tests__/`
- Integration tests: Run with `pnpm test:integration`
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/tags.spec.ts`

### Testing Standards
- Use Vitest for unit and integration tests
- Use Testing Library for component tests
- Mock tRPC procedures in component tests
- Use test database for integration tests
- Ensure tag filtering works with existing search functionality
