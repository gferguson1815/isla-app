# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt
"Create the UX design and wireframes for the Modern Link Management Platform using the PRD at docs/prd.md. Focus on creating a Dub.co interface that makes link management intuitive for non-technical marketing teams. Pay special attention to the inline editing paradigms, real-time collaboration features, and the Chrome extension design."

## Architect Prompt
"Create the technical architecture document for the Modern Link Management Platform using the PRD at docs/prd.md. Design a serverless architecture using Next.js, Supabase, and Vercel that supports both immediate MVP delivery and future scaling. Key technical challenges to address: 1) Real-time analytics with PostgreSQL at scale, 2) Sub-50ms redirect latency globally, 3) Multi-tenant data isolation with RLS, 4) Chrome extension authentication flow. Ensure the architecture supports future API and mobile app additions without major refactoring."
