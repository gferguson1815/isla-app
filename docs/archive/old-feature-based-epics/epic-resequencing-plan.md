# Epic Resequencing Plan

## Executive Summary

This document addresses critical dependency issues in the current epic sequence and provides an optimized ordering that eliminates forward dependencies, improves value delivery, and ensures smooth development flow.

## Issues with Current Sequence

### 1. Forward Dependency Problem
**Issue**: Epic 4 (Chrome Extension) Story 4.2 requires "workspace selector" but Epic 2 (Workspaces) hasn't been completed yet.
**Impact**: Extension can't be fully functional without workspace support.

### 2. Analytics Timing Problem
**Issue**: Users need analytics (Epic 3) before they need team collaboration (Epic 2).
**Impact**: Individual users wait too long for core value (analytics).

### 3. Admin Tools Timing
**Issue**: Epic 5 (Admin) comes last, but operational tools are needed during beta.
**Impact**: No way to manage early users or handle support issues.

## Optimized Epic Sequence

### PHASE 1: Core Platform (Week 1)
**Epic 1: Foundation & Core Link Management**
- Unchanged - provides essential infrastructure
- Delivers immediate value with basic link shortening
- Includes basic real-time analytics
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Enables**: All other epics

### PHASE 2: Enhanced Analytics (Week 2, Days 1-3)
**Epic 3A: Individual Analytics (Extracted from Epic 3)**
- Move Stories 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 here (analytics without team features)
- Provides deep analytics for individual users
- UTM parameter management
- **Dependencies**: Epic 1 (links and click events exist)
- **Enables**: Better value prop before team features

**New Story Order for Epic 3A:**
1. Story 3.1: Enhanced Analytics Data Collection
2. Story 3.2: Analytics Dashboard UI
3. Story 3.3: UTM Parameter Management

### PHASE 3: Team Collaboration (Week 2, Days 4-7)
**Epic 2: Team Workspaces & Collaboration**
- Now users have analytics to share with team
- Full workspace implementation
- **Dependencies**: Epic 1 (users and links exist)
- **Enables**: Team analytics, extension workspaces

### PHASE 4: Campaign Analytics (Week 3, Days 1-2)
**Epic 3B: Team Analytics (Remainder of Epic 3)**
- Stories 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 (campaign grouping, reports, integrations)
- Builds on workspaces for team-level analytics
- **Dependencies**: Epic 2 (workspaces exist)
- **Enables**: Full team analytics experience

**Story Order for Epic 3B:**
4. Story 3.4: Campaign Grouping and Reporting
5. Story 3.5: Custom Reports and Dashboards
6. Story 3.6: Third-party Analytics Integration

### PHASE 5: Growth Features (Week 3, Days 3-5)
**Epic 4: Chrome Extension & Viral Features**
- Can now properly integrate workspace selector
- Full functionality from day one
- **Dependencies**: Epic 2 (workspaces for selector)
- **Enables**: Viral growth, convenience features

### PHASE 6: Operations (Week 3, Days 6-7)
**Epic 5: Platform Administration**
- Could run parallel with Phase 4-5 if needed
- Critical for beta management
- **Dependencies**: Epic 1 (users exist)
- **Enables**: Platform operations

## Dependency Flow Visualization

```
Week 1: Epic 1 (Foundation)
           ↓
Week 2: Epic 3A (Individual Analytics) → Epic 2 (Workspaces)
           ↓                                    ↓
Week 3: Epic 3B (Team Analytics) ← ← ← ← ← ← ←
           ↓
        Epic 4 (Extension)
           ↓
        Epic 5 (Admin)
```

## Story-Level Adjustments

### Epic 1 Additions
Add to Story 1.6 (Basic Analytics Dashboard):
```markdown
8. Analytics data structure supports future workspace segmentation
9. User-level analytics isolation with preparation for team views
```

### Epic 2 Adjustments
Update Story 2.1 to reference existing analytics:
```markdown
8. Workspace analytics aggregates member link analytics
9. Smooth transition from individual to team analytics view
```

### Epic 3 Split
**Epic 3A: Individual Analytics & Attribution**
- Stories 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
- Remove workspace/team references
- Focus on personal dashboard

**Epic 3B: Team Analytics & Reporting**
- Stories 3.4, 3.5, 3.6
- Add workspace context
- Aggregate team metrics

### Epic 4 Updates
Story 4.2 can now safely reference workspaces:
```markdown
5. Workspace selector populated from Epic 2 implementation
```

## Benefits of Resequencing

### 1. Eliminated Forward Dependencies
- ✅ Extension no longer references non-existent workspaces
- ✅ Team analytics builds on existing workspaces
- ✅ Each epic only depends on completed work

### 2. Improved Value Delivery
- ✅ Users get analytics faster (Week 2 vs Week 3)
- ✅ Natural progression: Individual → Team → Viral
- ✅ Each week delivers complete, usable features

### 3. Better Testing Flow
- ✅ Can test individual features before team complexity
- ✅ Admin tools available for beta user management
- ✅ Extension launches with full feature set

### 4. Reduced Risk
- ✅ Complex team features don't block individual value
- ✅ Can validate analytics value before team investment
- ✅ Extension can be delayed without blocking core platform

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1 (Days 1-5)
- **Epic 1**: Complete all 6 stories
- **Deliverable**: Working link shortener with basic analytics

### Week 2 (Days 6-10)
- **Days 6-7**: Epic 3A (Individual Analytics)
- **Days 8-10**: Epic 2 (Workspaces)
- **Deliverable**: Full analytics + team collaboration

### Week 3 (Days 11-15)
- **Days 11-12**: Epic 3B (Team Analytics)
- **Days 13-14**: Epic 4 (Extension)
- **Day 15**: Epic 5 (Admin) or buffer
- **Deliverable**: Complete MVP with growth features

## Migration Path for Existing Plans

If development has already started with original sequence:

### Option 1: Hard Resequence
- Pause current work
- Reorganize backlogs
- Resume with new sequence

### Option 2: Soft Resequence
- Complete current epic
- Adjust only remaining epics
- Merge Epic 3 splits later

### Option 3: Parallel Tracks
- Developer 1: Continue current epic
- Developer 2: Start resequenced epic
- Merge when synchronized

## Success Metrics

Resequencing is successful when:
- [ ] No story references unavailable features
- [ ] Each epic delivers standalone value
- [ ] Users can use analytics before teams
- [ ] Extension launches fully functional
- [ ] Admin tools available for beta

## Rollback Plan

If resequencing causes issues:
1. Epic 3 can be recombined
2. Epic 4 can launch with basic workspace support
3. Epic 5 can run fully parallel
4. Original sequence can resume from any point

## Decision Required

**Recommendation**: Implement **Option 1 (Hard Resequence)** before development begins.

**Benefits**:
- Clean dependency chain
- Optimal value delivery
- Reduced complexity
- Better user experience

**Costs**:
- 2-4 hours replanning
- Story updates needed
- Documentation updates

## Approval

- [ ] Product Owner approval
- [ ] Technical Lead approval
- [ ] Development Team informed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Backlogs reorganized
