# Decision Rationale
decision_rationale: |
  CONCERNS gate assigned due to single medium-priority testing infrastructure issue that prevents
  complete workflow validation. The core implementation demonstrates excellent architecture,
  comprehensive unit test coverage, and all functional requirements are fully met. This represents
  high-quality production-ready code with a non-blocking technical debt item that should be
  addressed in the next development cycle.

  The implementation shows sophisticated understanding of React patterns, TypeScript usage,
  performance optimization, and security considerations. No code refactoring was required
  during review, indicating strong development practices.
