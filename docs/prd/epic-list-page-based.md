# Page-Based Epic Structure for Isla MVP

## Overview
This document restructures our MVP development from feature-based epics to page-based epics, ensuring each page delivers complete functionality before moving to the next. This approach provides clearer implementation paths and better user value at each milestone.

## Core Principles
1. **Build complete, polished pages** rather than scattered features
2. **No code without requirements** - Every page needs validated requirements FIRST
3. **Each epic** represents a fully functional page/section

## ðŸš¨ Mandatory Process for Each Page
1. **Create requirements document** (`/docs/pages/[page]-requirements.md`)
2. **Gather requirements** from Product Owner
3. **Validate with mockups/examples**
4. **Update story acceptance criteria**
5. **Only then write code**

See `/docs/prd/requirements-tracking.md` for full requirements process.

## Conclusion

This page-based approach transforms our MVP from a collection of features into a cohesive product where each page tells a complete story. By focusing on vertical slices of functionality, we ensure that users always have a polished, complete experience rather than half-implemented features across the application.

The Links page serves as our flagship interface, receiving the most attention and polish, while other pages support and enhance the core value proposition. This structure allows for clear priorities, better resource allocation, and most importantly, a product that feels complete at every stage of development.
