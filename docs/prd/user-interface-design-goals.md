# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The interface embodies "The Notion of Link Management" - a clean, modern workspace that feels instantly familiar to users of contemporary productivity tools. Every interaction prioritizes clarity and speed, with progressive disclosure revealing advanced features as users grow. The design philosophy centers on making complex data beautiful and actionable, transforming analytics from intimidating charts into clear insights that guide marketing decisions.

**Our UX North Star: Dub.co** - We aim to match the exceptional user experience of Dub.co, which represents the gold standard in link management interfaces. Their combination of developer-friendly power tools with consumer-grade simplicity is exactly what we're building. Every UX decision should be measured against: "Is this as good as Dub.co?"

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Inline Editing**: Click any link property to edit in place without modal dialogs
- **Drag-and-Drop Organization**: Reorder links, move between folders, and organize campaigns through natural gestures
- **Command Palette**: Keyboard-first navigation with cmd+K for power users
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Live cursors and presence indicators when team members work together
- **Smart Defaults**: Automatic slug generation, UTM suggestions, and folder organization based on patterns
- **One-Click Actions**: Create, share, and analyze links with minimal clicks from any context

## Core Screens and Views
- **Dashboard Home**: Overview metrics, recent links, and team activity feed
- **Link Manager**: Table view with inline editing, bulk operations, and powerful filtering
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time metrics with campaign performance and geographic visualization
- **Workspace Settings**: Team management, billing, and workspace customization
- **Quick Create Modal**: Accessible from anywhere via hotkey or extension
- **Campaign View**: Grouped links with aggregate metrics and attribution tracking
- **Chrome Extension Popup**: Compact link creator with instant analytics access

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Full keyboard navigation, screen reader support, proper ARIA labels, and sufficient color contrast throughout the application. Focus indicators and skip navigation links ensure efficient navigation for all users.

## Branding
Clean, professional aesthetic with subtle gradients and micro-animations. The design system uses a neutral base palette with customizable accent colors per workspace. Typography emphasizes readability with Inter font (matching Dub.co) with system font fallbacks for performance. The overall feel balances professional credibility with approachable simplicity - think "Dub.co meets Notion" rather than "enterprise dashboard." We specifically embrace Dub.co's monochromatic elegance with black primary actions, subtle grays for hierarchy, and minimal color usage except for semantic states (success/warning/error).

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Fully responsive design that adapts from mobile (320px) to ultra-wide displays (2560px+). Mobile experience prioritizes link creation and quick analytics checks. Desktop experience enables full campaign management and detailed analysis. Progressive Web App capabilities for app-like mobile experience.
