# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Deliver a modern link management platform that makes URL shortening and analytics accessible to SMB marketing teams
- Enable non-technical users to track campaign performance without spreadsheets or technical expertise
- Create collaborative workspaces where teams can organize and track links together
- Achieve product-market fit with 100+ active paying customers by Month 3
- Build foundation for future attribution platform and partner program management capabilities
- Establish smooth user onboarding with time-to-value under 2 minutes

## Background Context

The modern link management platform addresses a critical gap in the SMB market between expensive legacy tools like Bitly ($35/month entry) and complex developer-first solutions like Dub.co. Based on our research, SMB marketing teams currently waste hours manually tracking campaigns in spreadsheets and cannot accurately attribute conversions. This platform brings enterprise-grade capabilities through a Notion-like interface, making professional link management accessible without technical expertise. The progressive pricing model ($0→$19→$49) and viral distribution through branded links creates sustainable competitive advantage in this underserved market.
