# Technical Risks & Mitigation

## High-Priority Risks

**1. Real-time Analytics at Scale**
- **Risk**: PostgreSQL may struggle with real-time aggregations at 10,000+ clicks/day
- **Impact**: Dashboard performance degradation, increased infrastructure costs
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Implement materialized views for common aggregations
  - Use time-series partitioning for click_events table
  - Consider Redis caching for hot data
  - Plan architectural spike in Story 3.1 to validate approach
  - Have contingency plan to move to ClickHouse if needed post-MVP

**2. Global Redirect Latency**
- **Risk**: Achieving sub-50ms redirects globally with single region deployment
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, especially for international users
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Use Vercel Edge Functions for global distribution
  - Implement aggressive caching strategies
  - Pre-warm edge functions in key regions
  - Monitor P95 latency from day one

**3. Chrome Extension Token Security**
- **Risk**: Secure token management across browser/server boundary
- **Impact**: Potential security vulnerabilities, auth complexity
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Use Chrome's secure storage APIs
  - Implement token rotation strategy
  - Short-lived tokens with refresh mechanism
  - Security audit before public release

**4. Multi-tenant Data Isolation**
- **Risk**: RLS policy mistakes could expose cross-tenant data
- **Impact**: Critical security breach, loss of customer trust
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Comprehensive RLS policy testing suite
  - Regular security audits of policies
  - Implement additional application-level checks
  - Use Supabase's built-in RLS helpers

## Medium-Priority Risks

**5. Supabase Vendor Lock-in**
- **Risk**: Heavy reliance on Supabase-specific features
- **Impact**: Difficult/expensive to migrate if needed
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Abstract Supabase-specific code into service layers
  - Document all Supabase dependencies
  - Maintain migration strategy to standard PostgreSQL
