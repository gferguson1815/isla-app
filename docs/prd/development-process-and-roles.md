## üöÄ Simplified Process (What Actually Happens)

### You Say:
"Let's build the Analytics page next"

### We Do:
1. **Requirements Session** (30-60 min)
   - Me: "What should the analytics page show?"
   - You: "It should show click data, geographic data..."
   - Me: "How should it be filtered?"
   - You: "By date range, link, domain..."
   - We document all decisions

2. **I Create Stories**
   ```
   Story 2.1: Analytics dashboard layout
   Story 2.2: Click metrics charts
   Story 2.3: Geographic visualization
   Story 2.4: Date range filtering
   ```

3. **I Build**
   - Follow requirements exactly
   - Show you progress updates
   - Ask questions if anything unclear

4. **You Validate**
   - "Yes, this is what I wanted" ‚úÖ
   - Or "Can we change X?" (iterate)

## üìù Typical Conversation Flow

### Starting a New Page:
```
You: "Let's build the Domains page"
Me: "Great! Let me create a requirements doc. Let's go through what this page needs..."
```

### During Requirements:
```
Me: "Should users be able to add custom domains on the free plan?"
You: "No, that's a paid feature only"
Me: "Got it. What error message should free users see?"
You: "Show 'Upgrade to add custom domains' with upgrade button"
```

### After Building:
```
Me: "The Domains page is ready. Here's what I built: [details]"
You: "Looks good, but can we change the domain verification flow?"
Me: "Sure, what would you prefer?"
```

## üîÑ Lightweight Agile Process

We're using a **simplified agile approach**:

### No Heavy Process
- ‚ùå No sprint planning meetings
- ‚ùå No daily standups

## üéØ Decision Points for You

### 1. Page Priority
"Which page should we build next?"
- Based on business value
- Based on user needs
- Based on dependencies

### 2. Requirements Depth
"How detailed should requirements be?"
- Option A: High-level (faster, more flexibility)
- Option B: Very detailed (slower, more precision)
- Recommendation: Detailed for complex pages, high-level for simple ones

### 3. Review Frequency
"How often do you want to review progress?"
- After each story
- After each page
- Daily updates
- Only when complete

### 4. Change Management
"What if requirements change mid-build?"
- Stop and re-plan
- Note for v2
- Adjust on the fly
- Depends on impact

### For Links Page:
1. **Requirements**: ‚úÖ Complete
2. **Stories**: ‚úÖ Created
3. **Implementation**: Ready to build
4. **Your Action Needed**: None, we can proceed

3. **How should I handle ambiguity?**
   - Make reasonable assumption and note it
   - Always ask before proceeding

## üìÖ What Happens Next

### Immediate:
1. You provide onboarding requirements
2. I complete onboarding page
3. We validate and deploy

### Then:
1. You choose next page priority
2. We gather requirements
3. I build
4. Repeat

### No Formal Sprints
We work in a continuous flow:
- Build page ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Choose next page ‚Üí Repeat
- Each page is essentially a "mini sprint"
- Delivery when ready, not on fixed schedule
