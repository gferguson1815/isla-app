# Requirements Tracking - Master Document

## 🚨 Critical Rule: No Code Without Requirements

**Every page must have validated requirements BEFORE any development begins.**

---

## 📋 Requirements Gathering Template

For each page, create: `/docs/pages/[page-name]-requirements.md`

### Standard Sections Required:
1. **Page Overview** - URL, purpose, when shown
2. **Visual Design** - Layout, styling, responsive behavior
3. **Data & Content** - What data to display, how to display it
4. **User Interactions** - Every button, link, form, gesture
5. **States & Conditions** - Empty, loading, error, success states
6. **Validation Rules** - Form validation, business logic
7. **Edge Cases** - Error handling, permissions, limits
8. **Mobile Behavior** - Responsive design, touch interactions
9. **Performance** - Loading strategy, pagination, caching
10. **Analytics** - What events to track

## 🔄 Requirements Gathering Process

### Step 1: Create Requirements Document
```bash
# Create from template
cp docs/pages/TEMPLATE-requirements.md docs/pages/[page-name]-requirements.md
```

### Step 2: Initial Questions Session
- Schedule 30-60 min with Product Owner
- Go through each section
- Capture all decisions
- Get visual references

### Step 3: Create Mockup/Wireframe
- Based on requirements
- Can be low-fidelity
- Validate layout and flow

### Step 4: Validation Session
- Walk through mockup
- Confirm all interactions
- Document any changes
- Get sign-off

### Step 5: Update Story File
- Add specific acceptance criteria
- Include all validated requirements
- Link to requirements doc

### Step 6: Build
- Follow requirements exactly
- No assumptions
- Flag any ambiguities immediately

- ❌ Wasted development time
- ❌ Frustrated stakeholders

### With Requirements:
- ✅ Build once, build right
- ✅ Clear acceptance criteria
- ✅ Predictable timelines
- ✅ Aligned expectations
- ✅ Quality deliverables
