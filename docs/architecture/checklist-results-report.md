## Implementation Priority

1. **Week 1**: Local environment setup, core data models, authentication
2. **Week 2**: Link CRUD, redirect service, basic analytics
3. **Week 3**: Team features, Chrome extension, admin panel
4. **Week 4**: Development environment deployment and testing
5. **Week 5**: Production deployment preparation and go-live

## Risk Mitigation Summary

1. **Environment Drift**: Automated migration testing across environments
2. **Performance at Scale**: Redis caching and materialized views ready
3. **Security**: RLS + application-level checks + admin isolation
4. **Cost Control**: Free tiers for development, monitoring for production
